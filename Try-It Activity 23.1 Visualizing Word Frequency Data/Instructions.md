In this try-it activity, you will begin by installing two Python libraries: notebookJS and NLTK. Then, you will use them to implement word frequency counting and visualization, first in Python and then in JavaScript.

You will begin the activity by loading text data. Next, you will use the NLTK library to reformat the text data. To reformat your data, you will begin by splitting the sentences into single words, or tokens, and removing any punctuation (for example, commas or periods) from your data.

Next, you will use the Python pandas library to create a bar plot that displays the frequency of the seven most common words in your data.

Finally, you will use the JavaScript D3 library to create a radial bar chart and plot the frequency of the seven most common words in your data on a polar coordinate system.

To complete this try-it activity, follow these steps:

In a Terminal window, run the commands below to install the notebookJS and NLTK libraries:

pip install notebookjs
pip install nltk

The notebookJS library is used to enable the execution of JavaScript code in a Jupyter Notebook.

The NLTK library is a popular NLP library used to perform operations on text data.

Download the Try-It Activity 23.1 folder and open it using your own local instance of Jupyter Notebook.

Run each code cell. Observe the code and the results.

Now that you have learned how to plot word frequency using the pandas and the D3 libraries, describe your observations. In your discussion post, use what you observed in the try-it activity, and respond to each of the question prompts below:

How did the NLTK library help you to generate the top seven word counts?
What is the difference between a pandas bar chart and a JavaScript radial bar chart?
Would you prefer using the D3 or the pandas library to create visualizations of word frequency? Why?
Research some available JavaScript libraries, and list at least three that you would like to use for future visualization projects. Explain why you selected these libraries, and describe how you would like to use them.
